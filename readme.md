### Why "nabbyl"?

The main concept was created when I have seen the [Starboy's album cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starboy_(album)), from The Weeknd. The colors are amazing! It was photographed and designed by [Nabil Elderkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabil_Elderkin). To create a unique word, I just added two B's and changed I by Y.
